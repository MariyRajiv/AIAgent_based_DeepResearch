# AIAgent_based_DeepResearch

📚 Project Documentation: AI Agent Based Deep Research
🔍 Overview:
This is a React-based AI Research Assistant that allows users to input research queries and receive synthesized answers. It simulates an intelligent research process using asynchronous agent steps, integrates with the Tavily Search API, and generates structured answers using simulated drafting logic.

✨ Features:
✅ Real-time simulation of research and drafting steps
✅ Uses Tavily API to fetch and evaluate search results
✅ Tracks progress and agent "thoughts" during each phase
✅ Organizes sources and generates an informative response
✅ Maintains a history of completed research sessions

🧠 Core Concepts :
  Component	                        Purpose
ResearchContext	       Provides global state management for research sessions
ResearchForm	         UI component to input and submit research queries
conductResearch        Simulates research agent steps and fetches sources
draftAnswer	           Simulates drafting agent to synthesize an answer
simulateAgentSteps	   Mocks agent-like thinking by stepping through phases

🔌 External Dependency:
Tavily API: Used for searching relevant web content
API Key: TAVILY_API_KEY 

✅ Conclusion
This project demonstrates a structured, modular approach to building an AI-powered research assistant using React and TypeScript. By simulating agent behavior for both research and drafting, and integrating real-time data via the Tavily Search API, it delivers an interactive experience that mimics how an intelligent assistant might gather and synthesize information.
The separation of concerns through context, services, and reusable components makes the app scalable and easy to maintain. While the current implementation uses mock step simulations, it lays a solid foundation for integrating real AI models like OpenAI, LangChain, or RAG pipelines in the future.
With clean architecture and room for future enhancements, this assistant can evolve into a powerful research companion for students, professionals, and content creators alike.
